Chawla, Olaf Wiest, Xiangliang Zhang\\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide\\narray of tasks. Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs,\\nthey have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically.\\nRecently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or\\ndecision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable\\nprogress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the\\ncommunity with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to\\noffer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems\\nbased on LLMs, as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to gain\\nsubstantial insights on the following questions: What domains and environments\\ndo LLM-based multi-agents simulate? How are these agents profiled and how do\\nthey communicate? What mechanisms contribute to the growth of agents'\\ncapacities? For those interested in delving into this field of study, we also\\nsummarize the commonly used datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient\\naccess. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an\\nopen-source GitHub repository, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-based\\nmulti-agent systems.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-12-21\\nTitle: SubData: A Python Library to Collect and Combine Datasets for Evaluating LLM Alignment on Downstream Tasks\\nAuthors: Leon Fröhling, Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini\\nSummary: With the release of ever more capable large language models (LLMs),\\nresearchers in NLP and related disciplines have started to explore the\\nusability of LLMs for a wide variety of different annotation tasks. Very\\nrecently, a lot of this attention has shifted to tasks that are subjective in\\nnature. Given that the latest generations of LLMs have digested and encoded\\nextensive knowledge about different human subpopulations and individuals, the\\nhope is that these models can be trained, tuned or prompted to align with a\\nwide range of different human perspectives. While researchers already evaluate\\nthe success of this alignment via surveys and tests, there is a lack of\\nresources to evaluate the alignment on what oftentimes matters the most in NLP;\\nthe actual downstream tasks. To fill this gap we present SubData, a Python\\nlibrary that offers researchers working on topics related to subjectivity in\\nannotation tasks a convenient way of collecting, combining and using a range of\\nsuitable datasets.\""

       "AIMessage(content=\"\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking about the latest LLM models. Let me start by recalling what LLM stands for—Large Language Models. These are AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. The question is a bit broad because there are several models being developed by various companies and researchers. \\n\\nFirst, I should consider the major players in this field to cover the most up-to-date models. OpenAI comes to mind immediately with their GPT series. The latest version is GPT-4, right? But wait, I think there have been some developments in other areas too. Let me check my knowledge. \\n\\nOpenAI has GPT-4, which was released in March 2023. They also have GPT-4 Turbo, which is optimized for cost and speed. Then there's the GPT-4 Vision model, which incorporates visual reasoning. But are these the latest? I should also mention if there's a GPT-5 in development, but I don't think it's been officially released yet. Maybe they're working on it, but the user might be interested in models that are actually available now.\\n\\nNext, Google's LLMs. They have Gemini, which I believe is their new series. Gemini 3 was released in March 2024. That's quite recent. The Gemini series includes versions like Gemini-3, Gemini-2, and maybe a Pro version. I should note the capabilities like code writing, multi-modal tasks, and their performance compared to others.\\n\\nAmazon's Titan series is another contender. The Titan 4 series was released in 2024 with features like contextual fluency and code generation. They also have Titan 4 Pro which is more powerful.\\n\\nMeta's Llama series has been making waves too. Llama 4.0 came out in 2024, with improved performance, efficiency, and multi-modal capabilities. They also have the Llama Code series for coding tasks.\\n\\nMicrosoft's models, like the Copilot series, might be relevant here. They have models for specific applications, maybe something like Copilot Pro for more complex tasks. Also, their partnership with OpenAI might mean they're using some of their models as well.\\n\\nOther companies like Anthropic have Claude 4, which is another advanced LLM. Then there's Baidu's Wenxin Yiyan 4.0 and Alibaba's Qwen, which are also significant in the Chinese market.\\n\\nI should also consider the capabilities of these models beyond just text, like multi-modal processing (incorporating images, audio), code generation, and specialized tasks. It's important to highlight what makes each of these models stand out, such as efficiency, training data, and specific use cases.\\n\\nWait, the user might also be interested in the latest trends. For example, some models are focusing on being more efficient to run, requiring less computational resources. Others are pushing for better real-world application, like in coding or customer service. There's also the aspect of model transparency and ethical considerations, though that might be more of a side note.\\n\\nI should structure this information by listing each company's latest models with their names, release dates, and key features. Maybe start with the most well-known ones like OpenAI's GPT-4 series, then Google, Amazon, Meta, and others. Also, mention any notable versions in development that aren't released yet, but clarify their status.\\n\\nI need to make sure the information is accurate. Let me verify the release dates and features. For instance, GPT-4 was indeed in March 2023, but GPT-4 Turbo came later. Gemini 3 was March 2024. Titan 4 in 2024. Llama 4.0 in 2024. Claude 4 in 2024. Wenxin Yiyan 4 and Qwen 5.0 also in 2024. \\n\\nAlso, some models have specialized versions like Gemini Pro or Titan 4 Pro, which are optimized for certain tasks. It's important to note those. Additionally, the multi-modal capabilities are a big trend now, so that's a key point to include.\\n\\nPotential confusion points: The exact release dates might be tricky if some models were updated more recently than others. Also, different regions might have different release timelines for models developed by companies based in specific countries. For example, Baidu's model is more prominent in China, so maybe mention the regional context.\\n\\nThe user might also be asking for the absolute latest, so checking if there have been any recent announcements. Since my knowledge is up to December 2024, I should mention that the information is up to that point and advise checking for the latest updates.\\n\\nFinally, I should summarize the key trends and offer to provide more details on any specific model if the user is interested. That way, the answer covers the main points without getting too bogged down in every detail but still provides a comprehensive overview.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe field of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly evolving, with frequent updates and new releases.

      "Summary: Macedonians (Greek: Μακεδόνες, Makedónes), also known as Greek Macedonians or Macedonian Greeks, are a regional and historical population group of ethnic Greeks, inhabiting or originating  from the Greek region of Macedonia, in Northern Greece. Most Macedonians live in or around the regional capital city of Thessaloniki and other cities and towns in Macedonia (Greece), while many have spread across Greece and in the diaspora.\n",

      "\n",
      "The relationship between Greeks and Macedonians involves both historical and modern contexts, with nuances in identity and political relations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Context**  \n",
      "   - **Ancient Macedonians**: Considered part of the broader Greek world, sharing language, culture, and religion with other Greeks. Alexander the Great’s empire originated from Macedon, a region in northern Greece.  \n",
      "   - **Ethnic Identity**: Modern scholarship generally views ancient Macedonians as an ethnic Greek group, though some争议存在关于 their distinctiveness within Hellenism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Modern Context**  \n",
      "   - **Macedonians in Greece**: Today, Greeks refer to ethnic Macedonians residing in Greek Macedonia, a region integral to modern Greece since 1913.  \n",
      "   - **North Macedonian Nation**: The Republic of North Macedonia (formerly Yugoslav Macedonia) emerged as an independent state in 1991. Its citizens self-identify as a distinct Slavic ethnicity, separate from Greeks.  \n",
      "   - **Naming Dispute**: Greece historically opposed the use of \"Macedonia\" due to territorial and cultural associations, leading to the compromise name \"North Macedonia\" in 2019 (Prespa Agreement).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cultural & Political Tensions**:  \n",
      "   - Debates persist over historical narratives, with North Macedonia asserting a unique identity while Greece emphasizes the region’s Greek heritage.  \n",
      "   - Diaspora communities and geopolitical factors further complicate the relationship.\n",

      "- Pakistan has nearly **20 million crypto users**, making it one of the world’s top adopters despite prior banking restrictions (e.g., a 2018 ban on financial institutions handling crypto).  \n",
      "- Challenges remain, including **infrastructure limitations** (slow internet, energy shortages) and concerns about crypto being used for terrorism funding (e.g., TTP reportedly fundraising via crypto).  \n",
