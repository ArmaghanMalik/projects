Information gathered from url https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/a-new-generation-of-transhumanists-is-emerging/: According to the text, an emerging trend in Transhumanist technology is the involvement of a new generation of transhumanists, primarily composed of individuals under the age of 40. This new generation is characterized by its diversity in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation, and religious/spiritual beliefs. They come from various professional backgrounds, including artists, physical laborers, and programmers.

The text mentions that the population of transhumanists has tripled in the last 12 months, with over 10,000 members in the Facebook group "Singularity Network." Despite its growing popularity, transhumanism still faces challenges from older transhumanists who dismiss the ideas of the younger generation.

The goal of the transhumanism movement is to use radical science and technology to overcome human mortality and improve the human condition. Some transhumanists believe that achieving this goal is possible by 2045.

Additionally, the text notes that the most viewed online document of the transhumanism movement, its Wikipedia page, is protected by individuals who only support a bland academic view of transhumanism. These individuals delete additions or changes that don't align with this view.

To gain a better understanding of the vibrancy and happenings of the movement, the text suggests looking at public transhumanist gatherings, student groups such as the Stanford University Transhumanist Association, and social media platforms where scientists and technologists discuss the transhuman future.
