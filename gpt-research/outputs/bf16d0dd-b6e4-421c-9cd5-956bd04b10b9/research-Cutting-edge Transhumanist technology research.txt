Information gathered from url https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSM-09-2021-0363/full/html: The text does not provide specific information about "Cutting-edge Transhumanist technology research." It primarily discusses the conceptual framework and market dynamics of Human Enhancement Technologies (HET) in the context of services marketing. It mentions various examples and themes related to HET, such as biohacking services, genetic engineering, neural interfaces, cryonics procedures, and at-home health services. However, it does not provide specific details or research findings about the current state of cutting-edge Transhumanist technology research.
Information gathered from url https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article/42/3/237/3817401: The text does provide specific information about cutting-edge Transhumanist technology research. It discusses the use of CRISPR technology in genetic engineering, specifically the modification of human embryos and the injection of cells containing CRISPR-edited genes to treat lung cancer. It mentions that Chinese scientists were the first to use CRISPR to modify human embryos in 2015 and that Chinese oncologists attempted to treat lung cancer using CRISPR-edited genes in 2016. These developments have raised concerns about the ethical implications and the need for regulatory policies in this area.

The official transhumanist position on the use of genetic engineering technology like CRISPR is also mentioned. The World Transhumanist Association, now known as Humanity+, has adopted a position that embraces the desirability and inevitability of germline and enhancing gene therapies. They also call for public financing of research and regulatory processes to ensure safety.

Ioana Petre's perspective on the moral justifiability of germline engineering is discussed as well. She raises concerns about uncontrolled heritable germline manipulations and the potential consequences of uniformizing human genomes through genetic engineering.

Overall, the text provides an overview of the current state of research in genetic engineering as a cutting-edge Transhumanist technology and presents different perspectives on its moral justifiability and potential implications.
