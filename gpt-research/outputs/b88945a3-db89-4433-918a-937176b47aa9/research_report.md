I'm sorry, but the information I gathered from the provided sources does not contain any specific information about the latest advancements in transhumanist technology. The texts primarily discuss the concepts, philosophical aspects, debates, and potential implications of transhumanism rather than providing specific details about recent breakthroughs or emerging technologies in the field. Therefore, it is not possible to write a detailed report on the latest transhumanist technology this week based on the provided sources.

If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, please feel free to ask.
