Information gathered from url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism: The text does not provide specific information about emerging transhumanist technologies. However, it discusses various technologies and concepts related to transhumanism, including nanotechnology, molecular assemblers, genetic engineering, bioinformatics, tissue engineering, artificial chromosomes, cyborgization, mind uploading, simulated reality, artificial intelligence, superintelligence, 3D bioprinting, chemical brain preservation, and cryonics. These technologies are seen as potential tools for enhancing human capabilities. The text also mentions books by Ray Kurzweil and Michio Kaku that discuss human enhancement technologies and their potential impact.
Information gathered from url https://www.britannica.com/topic/transhumanism: According to the given text, "emerging transhumanist technologies" refers to current and developing technologies that are used to enhance human capabilities and improve the human condition. Some examples of these technologies mentioned in the text include genetic engineering, cryonics, artificial intelligence (AI), and nanotechnology.

It is mentioned that transhumanists envision a future where the responsible application of these technologies allows for slowing, reversing, or eliminating the aging process, enhancing human cognitive and sensory capacities, and increasing human life spans. The ultimate goal of transhumanism is for humans with augmented capabilities to evolve into an enhanced species called the "posthuman."

The text also provides information about the history and figures within the transhumanist movement. The term "transhumanism" was popularized by Julian Huxley in 1957. The movement emerged around significant scientific advancements, including computer technology, space travel, and cryopreservation.

In the 1980s, transhumanist organizations and schools of thought began advocating human life extension, cryonics, space colonization, and futurism. Notable figures within the movement include K. Eric Drexler, Christine L. Peterson, Natasha Vita-More, James Hughes, and Hans Moravec.

Further, the text mentions the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), founded in 1998 by Nick Bostrom and David Pearce, aiming to promote transhumanism as an academic discipline. The WTA later rebranded as Humanity+ in 2008, advocating the safe and ethical use of technology to enhance human capabilities.

Key figures in the technology industry, such as Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, have shown support for transhumanism. Page launched Calico Labs, focusing on extending human life span through advanced technologies. Bezos and others invested in Altos Labs, which aims to reverse aging and disease. Musk founded SpaceX for human colonization on celestial bodies and launched Neuralink to develop implantable brain chips.

The text also mentions that discussions about the ethics and philosophy of transhumanism have become more central as scientific breakthroughs raise ethical concerns. Various emerging technologies like stem cell therapies, in vitro fertilization, brain chips, animal cloning, exoskeletons, artificial intelligence, and genomics provoke debates between proponents and critics of transhumanism.

Proponents argue that these technologies can eliminate disease, solve global problems, and improve human life, while critics raise concerns about social inequities and the potential exploitation of technology to create "superhumans." The relationship of transhumanism to religious beliefs varies among adherents, and it has been compared to the eugenics movement.

Information gathered from url https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-95346-1_12: The text discusses the emergence of transhumanist technologies, specifically focusing on two domains within transhumanism known as Dryware and Wetware. Dryware refers to machines attached to or implanted into the human body to enhance its biological condition, while Wetware encompasses biochemical technologies.

An example of Dryware mentioned in the text is the North Sense, which is a miniaturized circuit board that allows individuals to sense the Earth's magnetic field. It is attached to the sternum bone. The text raises concerns about the societal response to individuals with such enhancements, questioning whether they would face stigma, harassment, or physical aggression from others who do not have these enhancements.

In terms of Wetware, genetic engineering is mentioned as a significant aspect. It suggests that through genetic engineering, it is theoretically possible to select characteristics such as sex, eye and hair color, improved athletic abilities, and cognitive skills. However, as of 2021, these procedures are expensive and can cost around US$ 25,000 per attempt at fertilization. The text also highlights concerns about the potential objectification and instrumentalization of human lives through bioengineering.

Overall, the text emphasizes that the emergence of transhumanist technologies raises social, ethical, and philosophical issues that need to be addressed by society. It calls for further exploration of the market for these technologies and their implications.
