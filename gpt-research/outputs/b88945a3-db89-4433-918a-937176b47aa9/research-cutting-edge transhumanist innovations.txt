Information gathered from url https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSM-09-2021-0363/full/html: The text does not specifically mention or provide specific information about "cutting-edge transhumanist innovations." It primarily discusses the conceptual and theoretical aspects of transhumanism and human enhancement technologies (HET). It explores the ideas and goals of transhumanism, such as overcoming biological limitations and achieving superintelligence, super longevity, and super well-being through emerging technologies like gene-editing techniques, cybernetic enhancements, and psychopharmaceuticals.

The text also highlights challenges related to the adoption and consumption of HET, including financial inequality in accessing these technologies and the sociocultural factors that influence acceptance and views towards them. It mentions the potential reshaping of notions of humanity and the blurring of boundaries between humans and machines with the development of technologies like artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces.

In terms of marketing, the text briefly touches on the importance of consumer expectations, pricing challenges, physical settings, promotional strategies, and well-trained personnel in delivering HET services. It also mentions the need for research to further explore the potential and ethical implications of cutting-edge transhumanist innovations.

Overall, while the text provides an overview of transhumanism and its goals, it does not provide specific details or examples of cutting-edge transhumanist innovations.
