Information gathered from url https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-displays-here-are-the-rumored-upgrades-you-need-to-know: According to the text, the rumored enhancements for the iPhone 15 display include updates to brightness, bezels, and associated features. The display size for the iPhone 15 is expected to be the same as the previous models with two sizes: the 6.1-inch vanilla and Pro model, and the 6.7-inch Plus and Pro Max model. The iPhone 15 display is likely to be OLED, similar to the previous three generations, as Apple's microLED technology is not yet ready. The resolutions are expected to remain the same.

In terms of refresh rate, it is speculated that the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate will remain exclusive to the Pro models, while the standard models will continue with a 60Hz refresh rate. The always-on display feature introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro is expected to make a return in the iPhone 15 Pro, but it may not be available for the standard models.

The bezels of the iPhone 15 are anticipated to become thinner, particularly for the Pro models, with 1.55mm bezels, making them slimmer than any other smartphone on the market. The brightness of the iPhone 15 series could be increased, potentially reaching up to 2,500 nits for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Additionally, a new driver chip might contribute to more efficient display performance.

The Dynamic Island, which replaces the Face ID notch, was introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro and is expected to be available in all iPhone 15 models. The Pro models of the iPhone 15 series might support external displays with the inclusion of USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 compatibility.

Please note that these enhancements are based on rumors and speculation, and the actual details of the iPhone 15 display will be confirmed during the launch event.

Information gathered from url https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-15-always-on-display: According to the information provided in the text, the iPhone 15 is unlikely to have an always-on display feature. Leaks suggest that the iPhone 15 will stick with a 60Hz screen and cannot deviate from that refresh rate. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are mentioned to have an always-on display feature with a refresh rate of 1Hz, but the iPhone 15 is expected to have an LTPS (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon) display, which does not support the ability to drop to 1Hz.

Additionally, it is stated that the standard iPhone models won't get LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) screens until the iPhone 17 in 2025. This rules out the possibility of an always-on display for the iPhone 15. However, it is important to note that there is no explicit confirmation that the iPhone 15 won't have an always-on display. Despite this, only a few sources have discussed the refresh rate, making it unlikely but not impossible for the iPhone 15 to have an always-on display.

Regarding the iPhone 15 Plus, it is mentioned that it will likely use the same screen technology as the standard iPhone 15, indicating that it probably won't have an always-on display either.

However, it is expected that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will retain the always-on display feature. Apple is known for rarely removing features from its phones, and the text mentions that the iOS 17 update includes a new StandBy feature designed to improve the always-on display.
Information gathered from url https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-15-design-rumors-how-apples-new-phones-may-change/: The text mentions that the iPhone 15 is expected to have some display enhancements. Specifically, it is speculated that both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models may inherit the Dynamic Island feature from the Pro models. The Dynamic Island is described as a miniature secondary screen that can display information such as timers, sports scores, and Uber's ETA. Additionally, the iPhone 15 lineup is rumored to have thinner bezels, indicating a design shift towards a design similar to the iPhone X from 2017. To achieve slimmer borders, Apple might use a technology called low-injection pressure over-molding. However, it is important to note that these are just rumors and speculations, and official confirmation from Apple is needed to know the exact display enhancements and changes of the iPhone 15.
Information gathered from url https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/20/iphone-15-iphone-15-pro-features/: According to the text, the iPhone 15 is expected to have a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 15 Plus is expected to have a 6.7-inch display. The most significant display enhancement for these models will be the inclusion of the Dynamic Island, which replaces the notch and uses software integration to create the illusion of a single display cutout. However, it is mentioned that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will not have Apple's ProMotion display technology or support for an always-on display. Apart from these details, the text does not provide any further information or specific enhancements regarding the display of the iPhone 15.
