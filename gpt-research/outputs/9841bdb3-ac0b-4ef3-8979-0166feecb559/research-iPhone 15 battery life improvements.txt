Information gathered from url https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/entire-iphone-15-lineup-tipped-for-serious-battery-life-upgrades: According to a rumored report from an alleged Foxconn worker, the iPhone 15 lineup is expected to come with significantly larger batteries compared to the iPhone 14 models. The rumored battery capacities for each iPhone 15 model are as follows:

- iPhone 15: 18% larger battery
- iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro: 14% larger battery
- iPhone 15 Pro Max: 12% larger battery

This rumor suggests that the iPhone 15 models will have improved battery life. 

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are expected to be equipped with the A16 Bionic chip, which is already present in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. This chip brings efficiency improvements, which could contribute to better battery performance. 

On the other hand, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are rumored to have an even more efficient A17 Bionic chipset. 

In addition to the battery improvements, it is speculated that the iPhone 15 Pro will feature a reverse wireless charging capability, allowing it to wirelessly charge other Apple devices. This feature, combined with the improved battery life, could further differentiate the Pro models from the standard iPhone 15.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that all the phones in the iPhone 15 lineup are expected to come with a USB-C port as a result of new EU regulations. This means that existing Apple Lightning cables will not be compatible with the iPhone 15 models.

Lastly, according to the alleged Foxconn employees, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will come with 256GB of storage as the default option, while the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will retain the storage configurations seen in their predecessors.

To summarize, the text provides information about the rumored battery life improvements for the iPhone 15 models, as well as additional details such as the possible inclusion of reverse wireless charging, a USB-C port, and the storage options for each model.
Information gathered from url https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-pro-on-track-for-longest-battery-life-ever-heres-why: According to the information provided in the text, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are expected to have significant improvements in battery life. The reasons for this expectation are as follows:

1. Larger batteries: Compared to their predecessors, the rumored iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are said to come with larger battery cells. For example, the iPhone 14 Pro Max had a battery capacity of 4,323 mAh, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to have a battery capacity of 4,852 mAh. The larger batteries could potentially result in longer battery life.

2. Stacked batteries: There is speculation that Apple might introduce stacked batteries in the iPhone 15 Pro series. These stacked batteries offer higher power density and utilize less wasted space, similar to those used in electric vehicles. This allows Apple to potentially fit more active material into the battery without compromising the thinness of the iPhone. However, stacked batteries could lead to increased heat buildup.

3. Power efficiency of A17 Bionic chip: The iPhone 15 Pro series is rumored to feature the A17 Bionic chip, using a 3-nanometer manufacturing process. This improvement over the A16 Bionic chip found in the iPhone 14 series could result in a 35% boost in power efficiency. The increased power efficiency of the A17 Bionic chip could contribute to improved battery life.

4. Apple's track record: Apple has been consistently improving the battery life of its iPhones with each new release. Battery benchmark tests conducted by Tom's Guide have shown that almost every successive iPhone has outperformed its predecessor. Although there have been exceptions, Apple has generally made strides in extending battery life. Therefore, it is expected that the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max will also see improvements in battery life.

To answer the question, the text does not provide specific numbers or stats for the expected battery life of the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. However, it suggests that these improvements could potentially make them the iPhones with the longest battery life ever.
Information gathered from url https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/iphone-15-pro-battery-life-boost/: According to the provided text, the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to have a significantly improved battery life. This enhancement is attributed to the efficiency improvements brought by the A17 Bionic chip, which is anticipated to be manufactured using TSMC's 3nm fabrication process. This new process is said to provide up to 35 percent less power consumption compared to the 5nm process used in previous iPhone models. However, it is noted that the reduced power consumption of the A17 chip alone may not be sufficient to transform the iPhone's battery life. If Apple also makes efficiency improvements to other power-consuming components like the display and 5G modem, it is expected that the iPhone 15 Pro models could offer a noteworthy battery life boost compared to the previous generation. The text suggests that the A17 Bionic chip is not only expected to bring battery life improvements but also performance enhancements. Furthermore, Apple is believed to be the largest client of TSMC's 3nm production lines, although there have been concerns about the supplier's ability to meet Apple's high order quantities. The expected release timeframe for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models is the fall.
Information gathered from url https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-15-tipped-for-better-battery-life-thanks-to-new-apple-a17-chip: According to the text, the iPhone 15 is expected to come with better battery life improvements. The chip manufacturer TSMC has announced a move to a more efficient manufacturing process of 3 nanometers, which is an improvement over the current 5 nanometer process. The new chips made using this process are stated to use around 35% less power while offering better performance. Apple, which designs the Bionic processors for the iPhone, is likely to take advantage of the power efficiency improvements offered by these new chips in the A17 Bionic chip, expected to be featured in the next round of iPhones. However, it is mentioned that only the Pro models of the 2023 iPhone are expected to receive the new silicon.
