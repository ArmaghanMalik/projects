Information gathered from url https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-four-things-make-this-a-fun-upgrade-year/: The advantages of iPhone 15 features mentioned in the text include:

1. USB-C charging connector: The iPhone 15 product line is expected to switch from the Lightning port to the USB-C connector. This change allows users to use the same charging cable for iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and non-Apple accessories. Additionally, there may be improvements in charging speed and data transfer capabilities.

2. Periscope camera: The iPhone 15 Pro Max model is rumored to feature a periscope telephoto camera lens. This feature enables users to zoom in and capture photos of faraway subjects with improved clarity and crispness. Rival companies like Samsung have already been offering similar features.

3. Action button: The iPhone 15 is expected to replace the Ring/Silent switch with an Action button, similar to the one introduced in the Apple Watch Ultra. This button could offer user customizations with different sets of functions, potentially allowing users to access specific features or apps quickly.

4. Titanium chassis: Reports suggest that Apple might change the material of the iPhone 15 chassis from stainless steel to brushed titanium. This change would make the phone lighter, more durable over time, and potentially provide a better grip. However, it is uncertain if this upgrade will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (or Ultra) models.

These advantages are based on reports and rumors about the features expected in the upcoming iPhone 15 models. No specific numbers or stats are provided.

Information gathered from url https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/iphone-15-series-camera-specs/: Based on the given text, the advantages of the iPhone 15 features are as follows:

1. Higher Megapixel Count: The base iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will have a 48-megapixel camera sensor, which is a significant upgrade compared to the 12-megapixel main camera on the iPhone 14. This increase in megapixels allows for higher resolution images with improved detail.

2. Improved Image Quality: The iPhone 15 Pro models, including the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, will feature upgrades to the telephoto and ultra-wide cameras. These upgrades will result in improved image quality and higher resolution photos compared to the iPhone 14 Pro models.

3. Periscope Lens System: The iPhone 15 Pro Max will come equipped with a periscope lens system for the telephoto camera, which is an entirely new technology for the iPhone lineup. This system allows for significant improvements in zoom capabilities, with the iPhone 15 Pro Max expected to have between 5x and 10x zoom compared to the 3x zoom of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

4. Stacked Camera Sensor: The iPhone 15 is rumored to have a stacked camera sensor system, which enables faster readout speeds and improved low-light imaging. Although it is uncertain whether this system will be present in the final units, if included, it would provide an advantage in capturing low-light photos.

5. Future Potential: The text also mentions that in the iPhone 16 Pro models, expected in 2024, there will be an increase in size to accommodate the periscope lens system in both the Pro and Pro Max models. This suggests that Apple is continuously working on improving and expanding the camera capabilities of its iPhone lineup.
