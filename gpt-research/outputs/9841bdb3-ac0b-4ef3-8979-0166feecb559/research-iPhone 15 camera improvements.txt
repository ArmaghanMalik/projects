Information gathered from url https://www.t3.com/news/every-iphone-15-is-getting-a-huge-camera-upgrade: The iPhone 15 range will feature significant improvements to their camera capabilities. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to have the biggest camera upgrade, with a new periscope zoom lens system that will offer 5x to 10x optical zoom. This addresses a limitation compared to some Android phones, as iPhone zoom capabilities have been limited in the past.

The iPhone 15 Pro will have a similar main camera as the iPhone 14 Pro, with the same image sensor. However, the other two cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro will see an improvement from 12MP to 12.7MP and 13.3MP.

For the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models, the main cameras will see a significant boost from the current 12MP to a new 48MP Sony sensor. Alongside this, there will be a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera. The specific details about the sensor are not clear, and it is uncertain if the model that will be released will contain the previously reported stacked camera sensor. However, if it does, there is the expectation of significantly better low light performance.

Overall, the camera improvements in the iPhone 15 range indicate advancements in zoom capabilities and higher resolution sensors for improved image quality.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are said to feature a new Sony sensor that would extend the dynamic range of images, potentially allowing for more striking HDR imagery. While the megapixel count of the sensor is not mentioned, previous rumors suggest that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will have a 48MP main camera, a significant upgrade from the 12MP camera on the iPhone 14. Additionally, the iPhone 15 Pro Max could have a periscope lens, which would enable longer-range zoom capabilities compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The exact zoom range is not specified, but previous rumors have mentioned possibilities ranging from 5x-10x optical zoom. The cameras on all three iPhone models (iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro) are expected to be major highlights, with the iPhone 15 Pro potentially missing out on the periscope lens upgrade. The article suggests that camera improvements are much needed for Apple as its iPhones have often fallen behind the competition in terms of camera capabilities when compared to Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Pixel 7 Pro. The full details of the camera upgrades are expected to be revealed on September 12 at the Apple event.
Information gathered from url https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-15-camera: According to the text, the iPhone 15 is expected to have a dual-sensor camera setup with a 48MP main sensor, which is a significant upgrade from the 12MP main sensor found in the iPhone 14. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also anticipated to have triple-sensor setups similar to their predecessors. The main difference in the camera specifications between the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro is likely to be the use of new Sony-produced sensors that can capture more light. As for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, there are rumors of improvements to its triple-sensor setup, but the existence of an iPhone 15 Ultra with more advanced camera features adds uncertainty to the details. Additionally, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is rumored to have a dual-lens front-facing camera, instead of the single 12MP front-facing TrueDepth camera featured in its predecessor.
Information gathered from url https://www.gsmarena.com/here_are_the_detailed_camera_specs_of_the_iphone_15_series-news-59805.php: The iPhone 15 camera improvements can be summarized as follows:

- The vanilla models (iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) will have a 48MP main sensor with enhanced readout and low light quality. The main camera will have an aperture of f/1.6 and the ultrawide camera will be 12MP with an aperture of f/2.4.

- The iPhone 15 Pro will also have a 48MP main sensor similar to the iPhone 14 Pro. The telephoto camera quality is expected to be improved. The main camera will have an aperture of f/1.8, the telephoto will be 12.7MP with an aperture of f/2.8, and the ultrawide will be 13.4MP with an aperture of f/2.2.

- The iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature the same main and ultrawide cameras as the Pro model, but it will introduce a new periscope zoom feature with a zoom range between 5x and 10x. The periscope lens will have an 85mm equivalent focal length, f/2.8 aperture, and a 1/1.9" sensor.

- However, a leak from China suggests that the periscope lens may only have a zoom capability of around 4x, requiring digital zoom for higher zoom levels.

- The reason for making the periscope zoom a Pro Max exclusive feature could be due to space constraints. The camera module of the iPhone 15 Pro Max will be larger than the Pro and previous generation Pro Max models.

In summary, the iPhone 15 series will have camera improvements like higher megapixel counts, improved low-light performance, and the introduction of a periscope zoom feature in the Pro Max model.
